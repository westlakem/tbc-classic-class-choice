## Legend
All ratings will be on a 1-5 rating.  Just because something is rated a 1, doesn’t mean it’s “bad” or something you should stay away from, and might be the perfect class for you.  All ratings are based off of a 25 character raid makeup, and used as a distinguishing metric between the different classes / specs.

### Desirability – How much you're needed
  1.	Not really desired to be in a raid.  One spot generally saved because they feel bad for them or are needed in niche situations.
  2.	One spot generally reserved for the utility they bring to the raid.
  3.	One of these is needed in every raid, but only 1.
  4.	Multiple of these are desired in every raid
  5.	Multiple of these are highly requested for every raid
### Skill Required – How hard is it to play the class/spec combination to be defined as “acceptable”. 
  1.	One button rotation, no special use for the class.  Definition of a face roll class.
  2.	Mostly spam one button or needs to be somewhat raid aware
  3.	Has a simple rotation or needs to be raid aware
  4.	Has a complex rotation or doing different things based on the raid
  5.	Has a complex rotation and needs to be doing different things based on the raid situation
###	Skill to master – Same as above, except to stand out from the crowd.
### Leveling Experience - how easy is it to level to 70
  1. It sucks... No way around it
  2. It's a slow crawl, but doable
  3. Average, nothing to write home about
  4. A walk in the park, nothing can slow you down
  5. Ez-Pz
