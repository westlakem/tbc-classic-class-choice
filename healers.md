## Healers

You are the saviors of everyone in the raid.  If there is one thing I constantly hear over chat during a raid, it's "Heal me".  The raid's success often relies on how well you can manage your mana, while keeping people alive through their blunders.  Everyone loves a good healer, and there are many different types of healers in TBC to tickle your fancy.  Whether it's landing massive heals on a tank, or healing the masses, everyone can find their flavor of healer in wow TBC.  Check out the different healers below for more information:

[Resto Shaman](healers/shaman.md)<br/>
[Holy Priest](healers/holy-priest.md)<br/>
[Resto Druid](healers/druid.md)<br/>
[Holy Paladin](healers/paladin.md)

_Note: While discipline priests are an option in TBC the community generally agrees that the additional healing from going holy is better than the 2 utility spells pain suppression and Power Infusion. Other than that, the playstyle is practically identical_.
