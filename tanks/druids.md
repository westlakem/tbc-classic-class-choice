## Druid Tanks

### Ratings
__Dungion Desirability - 4/5__<br>
Every dungeon needs a tank, and while paladins are more desirable, druids handle dungeons just fine.  You also have the benefit of being able to tank or dps dungeons, increasing the likelyhood of getting a spot.

__Raid Desirability - 3/5__<br>
Every 25 man raid needs 1 of these, but it is not unheard of to have 2.  You will be called on to tank on fights that require more than 2 tanks, dps on fights that don't, and quickly switch roles during different points in the fight or when something goes wrong.  You'll also be called upon to tank bosses that require your large armor and health pool to soak.

__Skill Required - 3/5__<br>
I struggled a lot on this ranking.  On one hand, the skill required to play this class effectivly requires you to learn practically 2 different toons (bear & cat).  On the other hand, the bear tank normally doesn't need to be in a mission critical position where if they screw up it will cause a raid wipe, so long as they taunt the guy they need to.

__Skill to master - 5/5__<br>
Mastering the druid is no simple feat.  You must master both bear and cat form to truly master this class.  You will be able to be competitive on the damage charts, the befiest badass bear, and be able to switch between the 2 at the press of a button.  You'll use catform to cross the battlefield quickly, and pull off feats other tanks could only dream of doing.

__Leveling Experience - 4/5__<br>
Let's face it... You're a druid.  Not only are you a druid, you're the most versatile druid.  You're a tank when you need to be, dps when you can be, and inbetween mobs can pop yourself a heal and keep going.  You'll be able to tank or dps dungeons, and with a single set of gear fly your way to 70.

__Overall 4/5__<br>
Overall, you cannot go wrong with rolling a druid if you want to be the most flexible dps/tank combination you can be.  Your raid will need 1 (some have been known to bring 2) and your roll will very from fight to fight.  They are fairly easy to gear, and a great choice for newer players and vetrins alike.   When all else seems lost, people will see the bear pop up and take over where the other tanks left off.
