The fierce defenders of the world.  This isn't your WOW Classic expansion, but it's not all bad.

## Ratings
#### Dungion Desirability - 2/5
Every dungeon needs a tank, but honestly you'll be the last on their list.  People prefer paladin tanks, and would even prefer a druid tank over a warrior.  It's not the warriors can't do it, it's just that the rest of the group doesn't get to sleep and mash AOE while clearing the place. (this changes with a thunderfury)

#### Raid Desirability - 3/5
Every 25 man raid needs 1 of these, but only one.  Warrior tanks are not the end-all be-all tanks that everyone remembers from classic wow.  You will be called on to tank many raid bosses, especially those that you can spell reflect or need a big defensive cooldown on (shield wall).  You also start off being the only tank that cannot be crushed, and therefore are very powerful early on in the expansion.

#### Skill Required - 2/5
Honestly, let's admit it.  While the skill cap is huge for a warrior, in order to be "usable" you're there to do 1 thing.  Put the badguy infront of you, keep up shield block, spam devistate, and pop a cooldown when required to.  Generally speaking as the fight changes, other tanks are better equiped to handle those situations, and keep you on the boss.

#### Skill to master - 5/5
While being a "usable" warrior is relatively easy as long as you have compitant other tanks, being a master warrior tank takes a lot of situational awareness and being able to react to ever changing situations without thinking about them.  Oh and you have a relatively small toolkit to handle those situations, so there really isn't a "you press this button in this situation" guide.  Mastering a warrior tank is both very challenging, and very rewarding if you're into that kind of thing.

#### Leveling Experience - 2/5
Let's admit it, you're a tank.  You won't be able to open world quest very well, and most people prefer paladins and druids for dungeon tanking.  The only reason this isn't a 1/5 is because you're not a healer.  You are much better off going arms/fury while leveling to 70.

#### Overall 3/5
Overall, you cannot go wrong with rolling a warrior tank if you plan on raiding.  Your raid will need 1 and you will be called on most of the time to tank the big boy.  They are fairly easy to gear, and a great choice for newer players and vetrins alike.
