## Feral Druids

Able to shift roles with the press of a button, Druids are the most versatile class in the game.  Armed with the spirit of a cat, you provide a crit buff to all physical DPS in your group.  When things go south, you can always switch to bear form, and take some heavy beatings.

### Ratings
#### Dungion Desirability - 4/5
While not the highest DPS in the game, you have an ability no one else in the group will have, and that is the ability to go bear form and tank if your tank goes down.  Hunters and other physical DPS in the group will love you too for the extra crit buff.

#### Raid Desirability - 2/5 or 4/5
I gave this 2 different ratings, and that's because it is dependent on the player.  If you are dead-set on staying Cat, and never tanking when needed, you will most likely be replaced with someone who will.  You might get lucky and find a group that will let you do that, but generally speaking raid leaders will expect feral druids to tank when called upon.

#### Skill Required - 3/5
The cat rotation isn't too hard to manage, and you provide your group buff just by being in cat or bear form.  You should also learn some ins and outs of bear form, for those rare occasions you are asked to tank.

#### Skill to master - 5/5
Mastering the druid is no simple feat.  You must master both bear and cat form to truly master this class.  You will be able to be competitive on the damage charts, the befiest badass bear, and be able to switch between the 2 at the press of a button.

#### Leveling Experience - 4/5
Let's face it... You're a druid.  Not only are you a druid, you're the most versatile druid.  You're a tank when you need to be, dps when you can be, and inbetween mobs can pop yourself a heal and keep going.  You'll be able to tank or dps dungeons, and with a single set of gear fly your way to 70.

#### Overall 4/5
Overall, you cannot go wrong with rolling a druid if you want to be the most flexible dps/tank combination you can be.  Your raid will need 1 (some have been known to bring 2) and your roll will very from fight to fight.  They are fairly easy to gear, and a great choice for newer players and vetrins alike.
