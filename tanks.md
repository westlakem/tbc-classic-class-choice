## Tanks

Ah tanks, everyone needs you but you're so easy to be hated.  When something goes wrong, it's usually your fault (even if it's not).  Your success in raids will be determined by your skill, the other 24 people in the raid behaving, and your raid leader using each of your individual capibilities appropriately.  Here we will be looking at the 3 tank specs across TBC to help you choose what kind of tank you want to be.  For specific details on each spec, please click the links below.

### Where each tank shines

One aspect that many raid leaders miss, is the sucessful management of tanks.  If you believe "warriors tank the boss, paladins tank the trash, and druids are only for when your warrior has to take a day off", you're doing your raid and your tanks a disservice.  Burning Crusade really brought forward different capibilities for each tank and allowed them to shine in different ways.  The following is a _basic_ guide of which tanks can optimally tank each kind of boss.

[__warrior__](tanks/warriors.md)<br/>
Warriors are the best at tanking spell casters due to their ability to spell reflect.  They also have the highest amount of spell damage resistance between all the tanks.  They are also great if there is a single point in the fight where you need a big defensive cooldown.  Warriors are not great at tanking bosses that have high attack speeds, where they cannot guarentee shield block uptime and are likely to get crushed.

[__paladin__](tanks/paladins.md)<br/>
Paladins are best at tanking fights where there are a lot of adds.  They are also excellent tanks at fighting bosses with fast attack speeds, like prince Malchezaar at the end of Karazhan.  Finally, remember that paladins can cheese many mechanics with a bubble, that could otherwise wipe a tank.  Paladins are not great at tanking fights that require a lot of movement, or fights that silence the tanks.

[__druid (bear)__](tanks/druids.md)<br>
Druids are best at tanking fights where there is an unavoidable crushing attack due to their high armor and health pool values, or bosses where there are polymorphing effects (like in Grull's Lair).  Druid tanks in general tend to take spikier damage, as they are crushable and harder for your healers to heal.

__Closing Thoughts__

Finally, if you have just a normal boss fight, any properly geared tank will do the job, however it is optimal to use either your paladin or warrior as your druid can easily out dps both of them combined. In a situation where you need to use all 3 tanks, it's generally better to put the bear on the first target to kill, as they generate the most threat and that allows him to get into cat form quicker to contribute DPS to the rest of the fight.
