## Tanks

Ah tanks, everyone needs you but you're so easy to be hated.  When something goes wrong, it's usually your fault (even if it's not).  Your success in raids will be determined by your skill, the other 24 people in the raid behaving, and your raid leader using each of your individual capibilities appropriately.  Here we will be looking at the 3 tank specs across TBC to help you choose what kind of tank you want to be.  For specific details on each spec, please click the links below.
