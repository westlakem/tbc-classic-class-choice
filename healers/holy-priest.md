## Holy Priests

Before we get started, there are 2 different specs of holy priests often taken to a raid.  Circle of Healing, and improved Divine Spirit.  Each one brings something unique to the raid, and we will discuss each briefly in these sections.

### Ratings
#### Dungion Desirability - 5/5
Every dungeon needs a healer, and holy priests are in a good spot for this.  While not the best single target healers, you can effectively tank heal and group heal, with spells like circle of healing, prayer of mending, and prayer of healing. That lends you to being really efficient at dungeon healing.

#### Raid Desirability - 3/5
Every 25 man raid wants at least an improved Divine Spirit priest, due to the bonus spirit and spell/healing power they provide to the raid.  Many will also take a Circle of Healing priest to help raid heal, as they can heal the most people at one time.

#### Skill Required - 3/5
Being a holy priest requires the most amount of skill to play properly.  You have different AoE healing spells, multiple single target spells, and need to keep renew & prayer of mending on cooldown.  If you are tasked with raid healing, you'll need to learn when to use what spells to keep everyone alive.  If you are tank healing, your goal is to keep Inspiration up on the tank as much as possible.

#### Skill to master - 5/5
Mastering the holy priest just means taking what is already required of you to the next level.  As you get better at utalizing your healing toolkit, you can easily be the healer at the top of the healing charts.  Just don't go crazy trying to land the biggest heals every time, or you'll contribute to a lot of overhealing and bad mana management.

#### Leveling Experience - 3/5
You're a healer, and while you're no warlock holy priests have some dps potential.  You won't level the fastest but leveing holy is doable.  You also have the ability to hop into dungeons and heal while you're leveling.  Overall an "okay" leveling experience.  If you plan on open world leveling, it might be worth it to respec shadow.  If you plan on dungeoning or doing a mix of content, holy is completely viable.

#### Overall 3/5
If you're interested in being a healer that has a tool for any situation, and you're willing to learn the toolkit and fail along the way then priests are a good option.
