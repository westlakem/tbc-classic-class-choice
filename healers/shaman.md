## Restoration Shamans

### Ratings
#### Dungion Desirability - 5/5
Every dungeon needs a healer, and shamans are in an interesting place when it comes to dungeon healing.  While not the best single target healers, you can effectively tank heal and group heal. That lends you to be the best overall healer in the game for 5 man content.

#### Raid Desirability - 5/5
Every 25 man raid wants at least 3 of these, and it's often hard to find that many for a 25 man raid team.  If you want a slam dunk opportunity to heal on a raid team, a resto shaman is the way to go (especially on alliance).  Chain heal is the only "smart" heal in the game (which targets the lowest health raid members), leading to very mana efficient and effective healing with minimal overheal.

#### Skill Required - 1/5
I know I'm going to get a lot of flack for this because of "try hard" resto shamans, but honestly you can be "useful" just by placing your totems and spamming chain heal on the tank.

#### Skill to master - 3/5
Mastering the resto shaman is quite easy compared to mastering other classes.  Chain heal is your bread and butter, and with a good set of raid frames can easily top the healing charts.  Make sure to replace the totems if they get killed off, keep earth shield up on your designated target, and spam chain heal to your heart's content!

#### Leveling Experience - 2/5
Let's face it... You're a healer.  You're not meant for killing things.  If you're planning on leveling through dungeons, you should have a fairly decent time, but anytime your out doing quests, well, it's going to suck.  If you plan on leveling through quests, I recommend going elemental or enhancement.

#### Overall 5/5
Overall, if you want to play a healer class that is highly valued, easy to play, hard to screw up, and easily satisfying, play a resto shaman.
