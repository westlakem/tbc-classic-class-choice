## Holy Paladins

### Ratings
#### Dungion Desirability - 3/5
Every dungeon needs a healer, and paladins just check the box.  They're nothing special in dungeons and the fact they can only heal one person at a time means if a lot of people take consistant damage, they've got their work cut out for them.

#### Raid Desirability - 3/5
Every 25 man raid wants 1 of these, and you're there for the blessings you provide, to heal the tank, or to heal the tank more.

#### Skill Required - 1/5
Honestly, in a 25 man raid setting you can just spam max rank flash of light on a tank, and let the other healers deal with most other things that happen in the fight.

#### Skill to master - 3/5
There isn't a lot to mastering the holy paladin.  To truly master a holy paladin takes time, experience, and fight knowledge.  You'll need to have many ranks of holy light in your toolkit, know when to use each rank, and make sure your tank doesn't die.  You'll also need to know when to use blessing of freedom, bubble, and blessing of protection to keep your party / raid safe.

#### Leveling Experience - 2/5
Let's face it... You're a healer.  You're not meant for killing things.  If you're planning on leveling through dungeons, you should have a fairly decent time, but anytime your out doing quests, well, it's going to suck.  If you plan on leveling through quests, I recommend going retrabution, and even protection is more viable.

#### Overall 3/5
Overall, paladins are one of the most restrictive healers in the game.  They are there to help heal the tank, leaving the raid to the rest of the healers, and as such are fairly easy to play, but space in raids is generally limited.
