## Raid Comp

Raid compositions play a bigger part in TBC than they did in classic.  Instead of relying on world buffs, the difference between a prepared raid and one just slapped together is going to be raid composition.  As a raid leader, it is your job to make sure you have a group who's buffs synogize with each other, to get the best bang from the buck out of all your members.  Below I have 2 different raid compositions, one for hardcore guilds that will be looking to optimize everything they can, and one for a more casual guild that leaves room for characters that would otherwise be left out of the raids.  Please note that there is no 100% perfect raid comp in TBC, as there are not enough slots in a 25 man raid group to get all the buffs.  Take these compositions with a grain of salt, and adjust for your raid team.


### Casual

In this composition, we have the following:
* 3-4 tanks
* 7 healers
* a caster group
* a ranged group
* a melee group

This is what I believe to be the most flexible 25 man raid setup, where you can be prepared for anything (including a tank missing a raid).


### Hardcore
https://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/?c=uf95ned6go5777oqqq4mibpho000000000000000

In this composition, we have the following:
* 2-4 tanks
* 7 healers
* 1.5 caster groups
* 1.5 ranged groups

This build removes all melee dps except for feral druids (used to buff the hunters & to tank), and a ret paladin (to keep judgements on the boss at all times).  This is due to many fights in TBC not being melee friendly, and limiting the time melee can actually attack the boss.
